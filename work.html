          Using the standard form of our roller coaster’s graph’s equation, the zeros can be found using synthetic division. We must first find all possible rational roots using the factors of the constant over the factors of the leading coefficient, or “p” over “q”, for simplicity. In order for this, the rational root theorem, to be accurate, the equation must have only whole number values. To get rid of the decimals, we will multiply the equation by 10.
          <br>
          <br>
          The equation, in standard form, is: 
        </p>

          When multiplied by 10, the equation becomes:

          Therefore, the constant is 2500, and the LC (leading coefficient) is 32. We now solve for possible rational roots, by listing the whole number factors:

          Additional clues as to what the actual zeroes are can be found through Descartes’ rule of signs. Sign changes are counted to find the number of positive real roots. A negative is plugged in at each x-value, and sign changes are counted again, to find the number of negative real roots. Descartes’ rule of signs, in this equation, will tell us:

      <div class="work-text">
        <p class="work-text">
          From this, we can see that it is beneficial to test positive numbers, as none of the real rational roots will be negative. There could be 8, 6, 4, 2, or 0 positive real roots, as imaginary and irrational roots come in pairs.

          Let’s try using the number 5 with synthetic division. 5 goes on the outside, the coefficients of the equation go at the top, and from there it is just multiplication and addition.
        </p>
      </div>
      <img src="static/images/Work5.png" alt="Work5" class="work-image">
      <div class="work-text">
        <p class="work-text">
          As can be seen, 5 is a zero, because zero was the final remainder during the synthetic division. We can continue on from here, using the other resulting numbers as new coefficients, to continue in a large synthetic division chain, until all zeroes have been found. To cut out the lengthy process of guess and check, the correct zeroes will be tried immediately.
